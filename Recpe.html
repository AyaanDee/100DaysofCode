<h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <p>
<ul>
    <li> 200g self raising flour</li>
    <li>1½ tsp baking powder</li>
    <li>1 tbsp golden caster sugar</li>
    <li>3 large eggs</li>
    <li>25g melted butter, plus extra for cooking</li>
    <li>200ml milk</li>
    <li>vegetable oil, for cooking</li></ul>
    </p>

<h3>To serve</h3>
<p>
    <ul>
    <li>maple syrup</li>
    <li>toppings of your choice, chocolate chips, blueberries or peanut butter and jam</li>
    </ul>


<h2>Method</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Mix 200g self-raising flour, 1 ½ tsp baking powder, 1 tbsp golden caster sugar <br>and a pinch of salt together in a large bowl.</li>
    <li>Create a well in the centre with the back of your spoon then add <br>3 large eggs, 25g melted butter and 200ml milk.
    </li>
    <li>Whisk together either with a balloon whisk or electric hand beaters until smooth then pour into a jug.</li>
    <li>Heat a small knob of butter and 1 tsp of oil in a large, non-stick frying pan over a medium heat. <br>When the butter looks frothy, pour in rounds of the batter, approximately 8cm wide. <br>Make sure you do not put the pancakes too close together as they will spread during cooking. <br>Cook the pancakes on one side for about 1-2 mins or until lots of tiny bubbles start to appear and pop on the surface. <br>Flip the pancakes over and cook for a further minute on the other side. <br>Repeat until all the batter is used up.</li>
    <li>Serve your pancakes stacked up on a plate with a drizzle of maple syrup and any of your favourite toppings.</li>
</ol>
